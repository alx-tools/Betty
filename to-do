* make sure that each Betty function has a docstring, according to Python conventions.
* Check that each function is commented.
* Check that function comment is written in /* * */ format.
* Check ratio of comments per line, issuing a warning if ratio is high.
* Check that first open and end brackets per program start on new line, but that all the rest of the open brackets start on the same line as its initializing code. Maybe issue a recommendation instead of a mark down?

* Make sure that each Betty function has a docstring, according to Python conventions.
* Modify Betty such that comment lines are not counted as part of length of function (unless Ju thinks this is necessary)
* Check that each function is commented.
* Check that function comment is written in /* * */ format.
* Check ratio of comments per line, issuing a warning if ratio is high.
* Check that no line is longer than 80 chars.
* Check that first open and end brackets per program start on new line, but that all the rest of the open brackets start on the same line as its initializing code. Maybe issue a recommendation instead of a mark down?
* Maybe create a strict mode, where everything kernel-related is checked and enforced mark-wise; and lenient mode, where warnings may be issued but pass/fail mark not necessarily affected by all checks.
